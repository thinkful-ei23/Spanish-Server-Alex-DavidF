## Summary
Spanish app is a responsive full-stack application that allows users to learn Spanish through a technique called "Spaced Repetition". As the user answers questions correctly, the algorithm will wait a little longer before presenting that particular question again. The data structure that stores the words is a linked list.

## Features

### User Accounts
Visitors can create an account of their own and then login to that account upon coming back.

### Presents A Question 
Users are presented with a word in Spanish, they need to enter the correct English translation of that word and will be told if they got the question correct or not.

### Text To Speech
When presented with a word in Spanish, the user has the option to click on a speaker icon to hear the word in Spanish.
